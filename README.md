# Advent of Code 2023

Welcome to my repository for Advent of Code 2023! Here, you will find my solutions for each day's puzzle, along with detailed explanations of my thought process and strategies used.

Advent of Code is an annual event held around Christmas and New Year's. Each day between Dec 1st and Dec 25th, a new coding challenge is released. Participants must solve these challenges using a variety of programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript, C++, and more. For more information on Advent of Code, visit the [website](https://www.adventofcode.com) or [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdventOfCode).

To follow along with my solutions, feel free to clone or fork this repository and navigate to the appropriate day folder. Each day's folder contains at least files: `input.txt` (my input data for that day's puzzle), `solution.py` (my Python solution for that day's puzzle).

For a complete breakdown of each solution, I encourage you to ask any questions you have.

If you're interested in collaborating, I would love to hear from you! Here's a list of links to my solutions for each day of Advent of Code 2023:
